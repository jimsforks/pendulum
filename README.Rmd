Time classes for R, w/ time mocking capability via [timefuzz][]

**BEWARE: VERY ALPHA**

**Why?** - Some programming languages support [monkey patching][monkey]. However, R does not officially allow this (there's a way to do it, but it's a hack). Therefore, the only way that I can think of to "mock time" is to use a different set of time classes/objects. That is, we can't just mock time using `Sys.Date()` directly as there's no way to monkey patch the code behind that function.  Some may say it's good that R doesn't officially support monkey patching; there's definitely upsides; but a downside is that mocking things like time becomes difficult.

Package API:

```{r echo=FALSE, comment=NA, results="asis"}
cat(paste(" -", paste(sprintf("`%s`", getNamespaceExports("clock")), collapse = "\n - ")))
```

## Installation

```{r eval=FALSE}
remotes::install_github("ropenscilabs/clock")
```

```{r}
library(clock)
```

## usage

```{r}
clock(2009)$time
clock(2009, 3, 13)$time
clock(2009, 3, 13, 1, 4, 53)$time
```

```{r}
x <- clock()
x$now()
x$utc()
x$now("UTC")
```

```{r}
clock_now()
clock_now("UTC")
```

## use in a function

```{r}
todays_date <- function() {
  clock::clock_now()
}
todays_date()
```

now let's mock time

```{r}
library(timefuzz)
x <- time_fuzz$new()
## set to today + 5 days
x$freeze(Sys.Date() + 5)
todays_date()
# if you run it again, you get the same EXACT time
todays_date()
```

"unfreeze" and you're back to real time

```{r}
x$unfreeze()
todays_date()
```
