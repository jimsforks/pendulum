Time classes for R, w/ time mocking capability via [timefuzz][]

**BEWARE: VERY ALPHA**

**Why?** - Some programming languages support [monkey patching][monkey]. However, R does not officially allow this (there's a way to do it, but it's a hack). Therefore, the only way that I can think of to "mock time" is to use a different set of time classes/objects. That is, we can't just mock time using `Sys.Date()` directly as there's no way to monkey patch the code behind that function.  Some may say it's good that R doesn't officially support monkey patching; there's definitely upsides; but a downside is that mocking things like time becomes difficult.

Package API:

 - `clock_mock`
 - `clock`
 - `clock_now`

## Installation


```r
remotes::install_github("ropenscilabs/clock")
```


```r
library(clock)
```

## usage


```r
clock(2009)$time
#> [1] "2009-01-01 12:00:00 PST"
clock(2009, 3, 13)$time
#> [1] "2009-03-13 12:00:00 PDT"
clock(2009, 3, 13, 1, 4, 53)$time
#> [1] "2009-03-13 01:04:53 PDT"
```


```r
x <- clock()
x$now()
#> [1] "2020-07-16 16:34:18 PDT"
x$utc()
#> [1] "2020-07-16 23:34:18 UTC"
x$now("UTC")
#> [1] "2020-07-16 23:34:18 UTC"
```


```r
clock_now()
#> [1] "2020-07-16 16:34:18 PDT"
clock_now("UTC")
#> [1] "2020-07-16 23:34:18 UTC"
```

## use in a function


```r
todays_date <- function() {
  clock::clock_now()
}
todays_date()
#> [1] "2020-07-16 16:34:18 PDT"
```

now let's mock time


```r
library(timefuzz)
x <- time_fuzz$new()
## set to today + 5 days
x$freeze(Sys.Date() + 5)
todays_date()
#> [1] "2020-07-20 17:00:00 PDT"
# if you run it again, you get the same EXACT time
todays_date()
#> [1] "2020-07-20 17:00:00 PDT"
```

"unfreeze" and you're back to real time


```r
x$unfreeze()
todays_date()
#> [1] "2020-07-16 16:34:19 PDT"
```
